		The sample demonstrates the zooming support in Gantt chart.
		You can zoom in or zoom out the project timeline dynamically with following toolbar buttons.

		<li><code>ZoomIn</code> - To perform zoom in action on Gantt timeline.</li>
		<li><code>ZoomOut </code> - To perform zoom out action on Gantt timeline.</li>
		<li><code>ZoomToFit </code> - To show all tasks with timeline fit into available chart width.</li>
		<br>
		The zooming feature enables you to view the tasks in the project clearly from minute to year timespan. You need
		to include
		<code>ZoomIn</code>, <code>ZoomOut </code> and <code>ZoomToFit </code> buttons in the toolbar for performing
		zooming actions in Gantt chart.
		<li><code>ZoomIn</code> - If the user clicks on the <code>ZoomIn</code> icon we have increased the timeline cell
			width,
			when the cell size exceeds the specified range then we have changed the timeline view mode.</li>
		<li><code>ZoomOut </code> - If the user clicks on the <code>ZoomOut</code> icon we have decrease the timeline
			cell width, when the cell size falls
			behind the specified range then we have changed the timeline view mode based on the zooming levels.</li>
		<li><code>ZoomToFit </code> - In project, if the tasks are rendered in different time ranges, when the user
			clicks on the <code>ZoomToFit</code> icon,
			then all the tasks are rendered within the current viewable chart container width.</li>
