    <p>This sample demonstrates the Excel-like field list feature of the pivot table. The pivot fields are automatically
        populated from the bound data source, and they can be dragged and dropped to create and alter the report at
        runtime.</p>
</div>
<div id="description">
    <p>The pivot table provides a built-in field list very similar to Microsoft Excel. The top section of the
        field list
        allows the user to add and remove fields. The bottom section of the field list allows the user to rearrange the
        fields
        between different axes, including column, row, value, and filter along with filter and sort options.
        <br>
        <br> To show the field list independently, create as separate widget namely
        <code>PivotFieldList</code> and assign JSON data source to its
        <code>dataSourceSettings->dataSource</code> property. Simultaneously pivot table will be populated by passing
        its instance in
        the updateView method, inside the
        <code>enginePopulated</code> event of field list.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, user interface for calculated field, label filter, and value filter features have been enabled in
        this demo by setting the properties
        <code>allowCalculatedField</code>,
        <code>dataSourceSettings->allowLabelFilter</code> and <code>dataSourceSettings->allowValueFilter</code> to true.
