        In this example, you can see how to render a area series with empty points. Similar to line type series, but the area get closed and filled with series color.
        You can use <code>border</code>, <code>fill</code> properties to customize the area. <code>marker</code> and <code>dataLabel</code> are used to represent individual data and its value.
        Legend is enabled in this example with series type shape.
